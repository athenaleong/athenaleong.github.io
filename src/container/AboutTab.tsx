        Hi! Looks like you have stumbled upon my little playground on the internet. Welcome in!

        I am Athena. I am curious about a lot of things. I am most interested in reimagining childhood with tech. Whether that is designing better ways of learning, simplifying parenthood, or helping every child find their champion.

        When I am not beep booping at 
        <a href='https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/' target="_blank">

    , I am a research assistant at  
    <a href='http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/' target="_blank">
    &nbsp;Gopnik Lab&nbsp;
    </a>
    where I study how kids explore. I am also building Amigu, an adventure game to facilitate better conversations between parent and child. You may also find me at hacking away at noisebridge, taste-testing intriguing groceries or playing at an actual playground!

    Previously, I taught ML with
    <a href='https://ml.berkeley.edu/' target="_blank">
    &nbsp;Machine Learning @ Berkeley&nbsp;
    </a>
     and worked on many ML projects. Back in Singapore, I started makerspaces, built communities for technical people and made silly youtube videos about Lego!

  <p className=" mb-6 leading-loose">
    I love thinking and exploring with people. If you think we should be friends, please let me know - There are 7.7 billion people on this planet, how cool is it that you found me!
  </p>
    <p className=" mb-6 leading-loose">
        I built this playground just for adventurers like you! Go forth, I hope you have lots of fun here!
