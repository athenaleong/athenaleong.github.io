        I am Athena. I am curious about a lot of things. I am most interested in designing childhood experiences with tech. This could look like designing better interfaces for learning, or helping every child find their champion.

        I love whimsical things and getting into shenanigans with friends. Sometimes, I document them on my

        Previously, I did CS & child development at 
        <a href='https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/' target="_blank">
            &nbsp; UC Berkeley
        </a>
        .
    I've developed Amigu, an adventure game that transforms conversations between parents and children into an exciting journey.
    I also taught ML with
    <a href='https://ml.berkeley.edu/' target="_blank">
    &nbsp;Machine Learning @ Berkeley&nbsp;
    </a>
     and worked on many ML projects.

    I love thinking and exploring with people. If you think we should be friends, please let me know - There are 7.7 billion people on this planet, how cool is it that you found me!

        I built this playground just for adventurers like you! Go forth, I hope you have lots of fun here!
